Hello! My name is Zawad Munshi, and I’m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan. I hail from the Bronx, New York, and I’m glad you decided to check out my page!

Here you’ll find a showcase of some of the projects I’ve worked on — ranging from academic, industry, and personal  projects. My interests span computer architecture, embedded systems, digital hardware design, PCB development, and signal processing. I especially enjoy working the bridge between hardware and software.

I’m always open to connecting with fellow engineers, researchers, and makers — feel free to reach out if something here catches your interest!
