<h1>I don't believe in air travel. It's all a hoax, along with "space" flight. How can something weighing 70 tons stay in the air? Birds fly because they weigh very little. Chickens don't fly because they weigh alot. And a so called airplane weighs significantly more than a chicken. I have never been in an airplane, and I don't know anyone who has. People who say they have are just shills for the government who uses small drones (that weigh less than chickens) to spray chem trails everywhere. Those drones only look like they are very high because they are so small. It's a known fact that past a mile high, there is not enough air to breathe. Yet we are expected to believe that these airplanes can somehow provide enough air to everyone on board? Please. Not to mention that flying that close to the sun would cook everyone alive.</h1>
